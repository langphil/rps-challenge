<h2 id="task">Task</h2>

<p>Knowing how to build web applications is getting us almost there as web developers!</p>

<p>The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( <strong>MAMA</strong> ) have asked us to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.</p>

<p>Your task is to provide a <em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em> game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:</p>

<pre><code class="sh">As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors
</code></pre>

<p>Hints on functionality</p>

<ul>
<li>the marketeer should be able to enter their name before the game</li>
<li>the marketeer will be presented the choices (rock, paper and scissors)</li>
<li>the marketeer can choose one option</li>
<li>the game will choose a random option</li>
<li>a winner will be declared</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual please start by</p>

<ul>
<li>Forking this repo</li>
<li>TEST driving development of your app</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bonuslevel1:multiplayer">Bonus level 1: Multiplayer</h2>

<p>Change the game so that two marketeers can play against each other ( <em>yes there are two of them</em> ).</p>

<h2 id="bonuslevel2:rockpaperscissorsspocklizard">Bonus level 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard</h2>

<p>Use the <em>special</em> rules ( <em>you can find them here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock</em> )</p>

<h2 id="basicrules">Basic Rules</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rock beats Scissors</li>
<li>Scissors beats Paper</li>
<li>Paper beats Rock</li>
</ul>

<p>In code review we&#8217;ll be hoping to see:</p>

<ul>
<li>All tests passing</li>
<li>High <a href="https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/test_coverage.md">Test coverage</a> (&gt;95% is good)</li>
<li>The code is elegant: every class has a clear responsibility, methods are short etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Reviewers will potentially be using this <a href="docs/review.md">code review rubric</a>. Referring to this rubric in advance may make the challenge somewhat easier. You should be the judge of how much challenge you want this weekend.</p>

<h2 id="notesontestcoverage">Notes on test coverage</h2>

<p>Please ensure you have the following <strong>AT THE TOP</strong> of your spec_helper.rb in order to have test coverage stats generated
on your pull request:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">require 'simplecov'
require 'simplecov-console'

SimpleCov.formatter = SimpleCov::Formatter::MultiFormatter.new([
  SimpleCov::Formatter::Console,
  # Want a nice code coverage website? Uncomment this next line!
  # SimpleCov::Formatter::HTMLFormatter
])
SimpleCov.start
</code></pre>

<p>You can see your test coverage when you run your tests. If you want this in a graphical form, uncomment the <code>HTMLFormatter</code> line and see what happens!</p>
